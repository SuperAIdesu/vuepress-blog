Today the blog (sbeam.dev) got a complete overhaul. The backend framework was moved from [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) to [Gridea](https://gridea.dev/). 

今天本博客完全重建了。後端框架從[Hexo](https://hexo.io/)遷移到了[Gridea](https://gridea.dev/)。

All the data in the previous blog was deleted as most of the posts appear outdated by now. I hope the new blog will become a new place for me to write and publish without platform restrictions and censorship.

由於此前博客文章多已過時，所有此前的數據均已被撤下。我希望這一新的博客仍是我在互聯網上自由寫作與發表的平臺。

I will mostly write in English and Chinese. I may write about anything I consider interesting, including tech, media, books and general life. You can comment using the Disquis section below. Have a good time!

我主要使用中英兩種文字寫作。我會寫我感興趣的話題，包括科技、媒體、讀書和日常生活。可以通過下方的Disquis評論區留言。玩得愉快！
