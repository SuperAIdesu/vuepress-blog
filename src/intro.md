## Trivia 問答

### Who I am? 
I'm Kei (they/she), a self-proclaimed world citizen. My github link is below the top menu.

我是Kei，自稱世界公民。頂部選單下有我的Github鏈接。

### What do I do? 
I work in tech. My professional area of interest is in data science/machine learning, especially ethical AI. I participate in the open source community from time to time.

本職是科技從業者，關心DS/ML/AI領域。愛好開源軟體。

I am also active in queer and feminist advocacy and community work.

我也做性別多元相關的倡導與社羣工作。

### What open-source projects have you made?
An Android RSS reader, [here](https://github.com/sbeam-dev/SbeamRSS). It's poorly made when I was learning Flutter, and is currently not maintained.

Android平臺RSS閱讀器，[連結](https://github.com/sbeam-dev/SbeamRSS)。目前已不再維護。

Other school or work related projects can be seen at my [Github](https://github.com/SuperAIdesu).

### What's is this site used for?
It's a personal blog site. The articles reflect my personal view, which may not be accurate. The content is mainly reading notes and movie/theater/game reviews with a queer focus, with occasional life updates and rare articles about tech or ML/AI.

這是個人網站，所述內容僅反映個人觀點，並不一定準確全面。主要寫一些我讀書、觀影的感悟，有時也會寫技術或專業相關的內容。

### Why the site is called Sbeam.dev? 

I don't know either. I claimed this domain when .dev domains are opened for register. I think it's just a short domain that sounds good. I even don't know whether it should be pronounced as "S-beam" or similar to "steam".

在.dev域名開放時搶注的五字短域名，發音也容易，並無特殊含義。
